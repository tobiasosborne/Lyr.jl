# Lyr.jl — Lessons Learned

## Session Crash Recovery (2026-03-02)

**Problem**: Claude Code sessions crash, losing valuable research and plans.

**Recovery technique**:
1. Session transcripts are stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/`
2. Subagent transcripts are in `<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`
3. Most recent sessions: `ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/<hash>/*.jsonl | head -5`
4. Extract assistant text blocks with `json.loads()` → filter by `type == 'assistant'` → `message.content[].text`
5. Extract subagent prompts from `tool_use` blocks with `input.prompt` field
6. Subagent final results are the last substantial `assistant` text block in their JSONL

**Prevention**:
- Save research to files early (don't keep it only in context)
- For multi-step research, write intermediate results to `docs/` or memory files
- Create beads issues with detailed descriptions so the plan survives crashes
- If a plan is valuable, write it to a file BEFORE starting implementation

## Benchmark VDB Research Sources (2026-03-02)

## Ground Truth Test Framework Implementation (2026-03-02)

**Architecture decisions**:
- `test/test_ground_truth.jl` — 825 tests across 4 tiers
- Inline `_mean`/`_std` helpers instead of `using Statistics` (not in test deps)
- Constant TF `_TF_OPAQUE_WHITE` decouples TF lookup from extinction math for analytical tests
- N=17 voxels gives clean path_length=16 through center (AABB spans [0,16])
- N=33 for statistical tests where boundary effects matter more

**Pitfalls discovered**:
- `Statistics.jl` is NOT in Lyr.jl test dependencies — use inline helpers
- `PhaseFunction` type is NOT exported — must `import Lyr: PhaseFunction`
- `dot`, `norm` from LinearAlgebra needed when running standalone (runtests.jl imports via other paths)
- Trilinear interpolation at grid boundaries reduces effective density by ~1 voxel on each side
- For `delta_tracking_step` with density=d and sigma_maj=S: escape prob = exp(-d*S*path) but boundary ramp makes measured rate ~5-10% higher for small boxes
- Single-scatter renderer doesn't separate albedo well at low SPP — use multi-scatter for albedo tests
- Higher extinction doesn't always mean darker center — surface scattering increases, making direction of brightness change ambiguous
- `tf_smoke()` at density=1.0 gives BLACK color (r=0,g=0,b=0,a=1) — use custom TF for emission tests
- Phase function divides by 4π ≈ 12.6 — light intensity needs ~10-15x to be visible

**White furnace test insight**:
- With `emission_scale=0`, `light_intensity=(0,0,0)`, `albedo=1.0`: throughput stays exactly 1.0
- Background added at full weight regardless of scattering → pixels == background EXACTLY (atol=1e-10)
- This is variance-free (no Monte Carlo noise) because the only contribution is deterministic background

## Cross-Renderer Comparison (2026-03-02)

**Mitsuba 3 as ground truth oracle**:
- Install: `uv venv .mitsuba-env && .mitsuba-env/bin/python3 -m pip install mitsuba numpy`
- Python API: `mi.set_variant('scalar_rgb')`, `mi.load_dict({...})`, `mi.render(scene)`
- Output: numpy float32 arrays — save as raw binary with 12-byte header (H,W,C as uint32)
- `scalar_rgb` variant = one-ray-at-a-time, simplest, good for ground truth

**Parameter mapping pitfalls**:
- Mitsuba `direction` in `directional` emitter = light TRAVEL direction (toward scene)
- Lyr `DirectionalLight(dir, ...)` = direction TOWARD the light (away from scene)
- Must negate: Mitsuba `(0,0,-1)` → Lyr `(0,0,1)`
- Mitsuba `homogeneous` medium = zero spatial lookups, constant sigma_t everywhere
- Lyr fog sphere = VDB tree with density=1.0 voxels + trilinear interpolation — 10-50x slower

**Performance lesson**:
- 256×256 × 512 spp through VDB = minutes, not seconds
- Mitsuba `homogeneous` does same in 5 seconds (no tree traversal)
- **Must add HomogeneousMedium fast path** or drop to 64×64 for tests
- Never promise "fast" without profiling the actual code path

**Transfer function insight**:
- Lyr's TF is visualization (maps density→color), not physics
- For cross-renderer comparison: constant white TF `(1,1,1,1)`, `emission_scale=1.0`
- This reduces Lyr's rendering equation to standard radiative transfer
- Lyr is a SUPERSET of Mitsuba (can do everything Mitsuba does + visualization coloring)

## Float32 DDA Nudge Bug (2026-03-25)

**Problem**: GPU HDDA kernel produced 3.5x dimmer output than the linear kernel.

**Root cause**: `_gpu_dda_init` used absolute nudge `tmin + 1.0f-6` to avoid voxel boundary landing. At `tmin ≈ 178`, `eps(Float32) ≈ 1.5e-5` — the nudge is below the ULP and the addition is a no-op. DDA starts exactly on node boundaries, `floor(128.0/8.0) = 16` = OUTSIDE the 16-cell grid.

**Fix**: Relative nudge `max(abs(tmin) * 1.0f-5, 1.0f-5)` — always several ULPs above eps(tmin).

**Rule**: Never use absolute Float32 epsilons that get added to potentially large values. Use relative epsilons that scale with the value's magnitude. This applies to ANY Float32 DDA, ray marcher, or integrator that uses `t + epsilon`.

**Diagnostic approach**: CPU emulation of GPU code (the `_gpu_*` functions are pure Julia, CPU-callable) comparing spans against CPU Float64 reference. This was far more effective than static code analysis — 3 research subagents couldn't find the bug, but the diagnostic found it in seconds.
